    <h1>Born, Never Asked</h1>
    <p>
      It was a large room
      <br>Full of people, all kinds
      <br />
      And they had all arrived at the same building, at more or less the same time
      <br />
      And they were all free
      <br />
      And they were all asking themselves the same question
      <br />
      What is behind that curtain?
      <br />
      You were born
      And so you're free
      So happy birthday
    </p>
